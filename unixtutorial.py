		a program as stdin, and the standard output of a program as

		\"apple\", \"rwxrw-r--\".  We can interpret each of these 9 characters
		as a binary digit, where every r, w, and x corresponds to the digit 1,

		We can then go one step further by interpreting each triplet of bits

		\"7\" in octal.  Likewise, \"110\" corresponds to \"6\" and \"100\"
		corresponds to \"4\".  Thus, we have shown how we can rewrite

		understanding octal, consider that converting each of these 3-digit
		binary numbers to an octal digit is essentially the same as converting
		them to a decimal digit).

		These octal numbers can then be used in a \"chmod\" command.  To
		change the permissions of a file, simply use the \"chmod octal
		filename\" command where \"octal\" is the 3-digit octal number
		corresponding to what you want to change the file permissions to.  For

		UNIX shells are the environments in where we run commands and programs. 
		In fact, you are using a shell right now! Often, shells are opened
		automatically when you start a program. For instance, if you're using a Mac, 
		you're probably using the Terminal program; alternatively, if you on a PC, 
		you might be using the Ubuntu app. Both of these programs will open up a shell. 
		There are also other ways to open up a shell, which we will go into shortly.

		There are many different types, or "flavors", of shells. The original shell 
		was called "sh", and a later, also popular, shell was called "csh". However,
		in this tutorial we will be talking about the "bash" shell, as it is the shell
		that is the most commonly used today (and it is installed by default on the Zoo).

		In addition to being the name of a shell, "bash" is also a UNIX command that 
		can be used to create a new bash process. When you enter the "bash" command, 
		a new bash process will be created inside your existing shell. Feel free to
		try this out on your own later. (Note that you can use the "exit" command to 
		close your current shell.)

		Finally, the "chsh" command is a command that allows you to change your default

		You can use the "find" command to search for files in a particular
		directory (and that directory's children). The "find" command has a ton 
		of different options that you should look into if you are interested.

		For example, if you wanted to print out all the files whose filenames 
		contained "hello" in your current directory (denoted by ".") and its 
		children, you could use following command: ''')

		CTRL+Z to suspend any process running in the foreground.
		
		In addition, you can also run processes in the background. You can do

		instance, we could run "sleep 5" in the background with the "sleep 5 &"

		1. Now that we know the job number, there are a few things we can do 
		with this job. 

		First of all, if you wanted to kill this job, you would use the 
		"kill %1" command. This will stop the process. Alternatively, you 
		could move the job from the background to the foreground, you would 
		use the "fg %1". Likewise, you could move the job from the foreground 
		to the background with the "bg %1" command (this wouldn't make much 
		sense in this particular case because "sleep 5 &" is already running 
		in the background). Of course, if you wanted to call any of these 
		commands with a job with a different job number, you would replace 
		the "1" with the number of your specific job.
